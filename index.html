                <h3>Who am I?</h3>
                <p> I am Divin Gregis from Brazzaville, Republic of Congo. I have been living in United States since 2011.</p>
                <p>Before coming to the United States I have always been passionate of Information Technologies. My passion for IT started during my childhood.</p>
                <p>Indeed, during summer vacations when I was about 9 years old (26 years from now)I started working as an intern for my father's copyshop which was by the way one of the first copy shop opening in my country.</p>
                <p>Because adults around me were convinced that I was gifted and also because I enjoyed working on computers, I decided that I would pursue an IT career.</p>
                <p>After earning a Vocational training degree in Computer Networks at Hardware repair I started working in IT precisely in Networking.</p>
                <p>First I was hired as a Internet Coffee supervisor and then I worked for an IT Service Provider where learned multiple technologies through trainings and seminars.</p>
                <p> I have a background working in multiple fields of IT: Help Desk, Network Support, Programming, ATM... </p>
                <p> My objective is to be part of a dynamic and motivated team and work on IT projects from the beginning to the end.</p>
                <p> Later I would like to be an IT Entrepreneur. </p>
